# Bubble Up!

### [Play Bubble Up!](https://bubbleup.game.outright.io/)

<sub>Made for the [Global Game Jam 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/)</sub>

## Development

Built in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
with [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html).

<sub>To streamline collaboration, whenever a commit arrives to the main branch of this repository, continuous
integration (CI)
will automatically [build and deploy](.github/workflows/ci_distro.yaml) the game
to [web distro](https://bubbleup.game.outright.io/).
To further accelerate development and avoid caching issues, web distro is on AWS S3 behind a CloudFront CDN.</sub>
